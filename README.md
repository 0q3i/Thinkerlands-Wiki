# Thinkerlands-Wiki
Hello there player,

Welcome to the official Thinkerlands Wiki repository. Here, you can view the code, and if you wish, propose modifications to both the code and the content of the wiki.

# About Us
We are a team of players who think that the game is awesome. We've decided to create this wiki to assist both new and experienced players in their journey. While we are not professionals, we strive to provide the best information possible, though please note that it may not always be up-to-date, because we do have lives and are not full time on this project.

Currently, our team consists of two developers: one programmer and one responsible for gathering information.

If you're interested in joining us, please contact us on Discord at 0q3i or via email at 0q3i.discord@gmail.com.

# Plan
There is no specific plan for this wiki other than to share all the knowledge we have and to encourage the community to come together and create something great.
