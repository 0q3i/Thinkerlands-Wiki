            <h2>About the prologue</h2>
            <p>
                "A Shipwrecked Adventure" is a free prologue immersing you in the vast world of Tinkerlands. 
                Uncover the story of the first survivors on these mystical islands. 
                Explore the breathtaking archipelago, craft essential tools, build your settlement, and strive to survive!
            </p> 
            <br>

                The prologue is obviously much smaller than the real game, 
                but that doesn't mean you should ignore it, as it makes an awesome tutorial. 
                Since it is still simple, it is very easy to get used to the game. 
                We strongly recommend that you try it before playing the full game.

                Specs to be able to play the prologue:
                If your system can handle the prologue at 50 - 60 frames per second, you are more than ready to play the real game.
